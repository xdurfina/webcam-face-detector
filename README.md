# Webcam face detector using Viola-Jones (with background blurring) or DLIB(CNN)
In this repository you can try how Viola-Jones face detection has much smaller accuracy than 
using Convolutional Neural Networks from DLIB. I also implemented IOU function which you
can use for calculating accuracy and two functions which will scrape 'data' folder and
save faces data with pickle.
